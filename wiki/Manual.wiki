    -e, --compare        : Find d2 score of two sequences (stdout)
    -E, --compare_all    : Find d2 score of every pair of sequences and
                           outputs successfull matches in -C format (stdout)
    -1, --1 <int>        : first sequence to be compared (default = 0)
    -2, --2 <int>        : second sequence to be compared (default = 1)

  <filename> is a fasta formated file of sequences

Notes:
  1. The format of the compact cluster table (-c) is simply that each line
     contains all the sequences in the cluster. Sequences are numbered from 0
     and each line is terminated with a ".".
  2. The format of the extended cluster table (-C) is each line is a tab
     separated list of:
       Sequence1        Sequence2       ReverseComplement       d2Score
     where Sequence1 and Sequence2 are the numbers of the sequences in the
     file (starting at 0), ReverseComplement indicates whether the match was
     with the reverse complement (0=no, 1=yes) and d2Score indicates the d2
     score between the sequences.
  3. Each time sd_clust finishes an analysis it appends the log file
     (sd_clust.log). The line it appends the following info:
       f_name w_thresh w_size sd_thresh skip_val secs heur_pass d1_pass d2_pass
     where f_name is the fasta file's name, w_thresh is the heuristic's
     word count threshold, w_size is the heuristic's word size, sd_thresh
     is the standard deviation threshold, skip_val specifies every
     skip_valth word to check, secs is the time to complete, heur_pass
     is the number of potential matches the heuristic found, d1 pass is
     is the number of times the d1 heuristic passes and d2_pass is the
     number of matches that were found.

Examples:
  sd_clust -c my_seqences.fasta
    This will use the default d2 and sd options and output the compact cluster
    table to standard output.

  sd_clust -C -Q mysequences.fasta
    This will output the extended cluster table showing all overlaps between
    ESTs.

  sd_clust -c -t 20 -w 16 -s 2.0 -S 3 -n my_sequences.fasta
    This changes the heuristic to use a word length of 16, a word count
    threshold of 20, a standard deviation threshold of 2 and  it only checks
    every 3rd word, but doesn't check the reverse complement. Compact cluster
    table is output.

  sd_clust -e -1 34 -2 83 my_sequences.fasta
    This will calculate the d2 score between sequence #34 and sequence #83.
    Note that sequences are numbered from 0.
